# DigitalLoanPrediction
Digital loan eligibility prediction on a Nigerian Dataset using machine learning models
Failures of borrowers to make prompt loan repayment have affected the growth and future sustainability of digital loan platforms. 
The finance industry is faced with a challenge of extending digital loans to reach more borrowers while also avoiding potential financial risks. 
Machine learning has proven overtime to be exceedingly helpful in overcoming this challenge with its ability to predict borrowersâ€™ digital loan eligibility. 
The use of ML models will further make the process convenient, faster, easier, and hassle-free.  This study focuses majorly on how Nigerian Banks can utilize 
machine learning to predict loan eligibility of borrowers as well. Nigeria has a challenge with data, from access to clean data to efficient storage. Due to data
protection laws, real time data could not be accessed from the Banks in Nigeria. However, in our study, we applied four machine learning models, logistic regression, 
random forest classifier, support vector machines and extreme gradient boost classifier to a publicly available dataset on ZindiAfrica.com. The loan dataset which 
comprised of data from 18 top banks in Nigeria was made available online in 2018. As expected, the dataset had limited features. This paper focuses on the most effective 
machine learning model to be used by Nigerian Banks for loan eligibility prediction. The evaluation metrics scores shows that XGBoost and RFC had over 70% while LR and 
SVM had less than 60%. XGBoost model was the most effective for loan prediction regardless of the limited number of features existing in the dataset while SVM had the
least performance. This research also shows that contrary to the insistence of Nigerian Banks on the employment status of a borrower as an important feature, it is not. 
With this development, Banks in Nigeria can extend digital loans more than just salary earners, digital loans can be extended to self-employed borrowers as well who are 
eligible. Thereby, increasing the reach of the product, increasing profit and revenue while reducing risks.
